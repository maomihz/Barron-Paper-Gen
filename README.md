# Barron Testpaper Generator

## README
### Introduction
This software is used to generate a testpaper (wordlist) based on *Barron SAT 3500 Wordlist* **for personal practice purpose only**. Modifying parameters allow users to **adjust the range of test** and **the number of words in each paper**. The testpaper generated is stored in the same directory as main program's.
### Parameter
This software executes with two parameters:
1. **Range of the test** 

    The range is represented in **intergers** among 1-10. With a step of 1, there would be 5 more Lists added into test range.

2. **\# of words in the paper**

    This parameter is additional and set to **100 by default**. You may leave this blank or set it to specific requirements.
